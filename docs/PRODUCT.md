## Feature groups

### G1 — Typography quality (the font is the authority)

Everything the OpenType MATH standard defines, read from the live font at
load and used in layout. Deep detail: [ALGORITHM.md](https://github.com/clintecker/Vinculum/blob/main/docs/ALGORITHM.md)
(rule-by-rule TeX Appendix G audit), [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/clintecker/Vinculum/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

| Feature | Specific |
| --- | --- |
| Font-parsed layout constants | All 56 `MathConstants` values (axis height, every shift/clearance/thickness, script scales) — no hardcoded metrics |
| TeX style lattice | display/text/script/scriptscript × cramped; style-correct constant pairs; spacing suppression in scripts; `\displaystyle` family |
| Italic correction | Per-glyph: superscript/subscript split (`f^2_3`), integral subscript tuck (`\int_a^b`), stacked-limit skew |
| Cut-in kerning | OpenType `MathKernInfo` staircases position scripts against the base glyph's corner profile (STIX Two ships data for 233 glyphs) |
| Accent placement | Per-glyph `topAccentAttachment` (better than TeX's `\skewchar`); `AccentBaseHeight` seat; wide accents from horizontal variant ladders; combining-mark accents (`\vec`) via the glyph-ID path for exact ink seating; `\hat{f}^2` script promotion |
| Tall delimiters | Size-variant ladders → glyph assembly (end caps + extenders, constant stroke weight) → scaling, for every covered glyph |
| Radicals | The font's √ glyph via variants + assembly; font-true degree kerns and 60% raise |
| Display operators | Font's display-size variants at `DisplayOperatorMinHeight`, axis-centered; TeX Rule 13a limit clearances |
| Fence sizing | TeX's `\delimiterfactor`/`\delimitershortfall` formula |
| Inter-atom spacing | The complete TeXbook p. 170 pair table — all 8 atom classes including Inner (fractions, `\left…\right` groups, ellipses), transcribed cell-for-cell and test-pinned against an independent transcription; parenthesized entries suppressed in script styles; binary→unary reclassification (Appendix G rules 5–6) |

### G2 — LaTeX coverage

Deep detail: [COMMANDS.md](https://github.com/clintecker/Vinculum/blob/main/docs/COMMANDS.md) (every supported command),
[COVERAGE.md](https://github.com/clintecker/Vinculum/blob/main/docs/COVERAGE.md) (feature-by-feature with examples).

| Feature | Specific |
| --- | --- |
| Symbols | 404 symbol commands + 37 named operators (Greek, operators, relations, arrows, delimiters, letterlike sets), each with its correct TeX atom class — including the Inner class for ellipses (`f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)` spaces as TeX sets it) |
| Structures | Fractions (`\frac`/`\cfrac`/`\genfrac`/`\binom`), radicals with degree, scripts, accents, over/under constructs, boxes/rules/strikes, `\phantom` family, colors |
| Environments | All matrix variants, `cases`, `aligned`/`align`/`gather`/`split`/`multline`, `array` with column specs + `\hline`/`\cline`, `\substack`, `\tag` |
| Macros | Document-scoped `\newcommand`/`\renewcommand`/`\def` with `#1…#9`, recursion-capped |
| Direct Unicode | `∫ ∑ ≤ α` classed like their command spellings |
| Named operators | 37 function names; `\operatorname`/`\operatorname*` |
| Explicitly out of scope | mhchem, siunitx, `\href`, embedded HTML, `\begin{CD}` |

### G3 — Integration surfaces

Deep detail: [INTEGRATION.md](https://github.com/clintecker/Vinculum/blob/main/docs/INTEGRATION.md), DocC catalog (Xcode ▸
Product ▸ Build Documentation).

| Surface | Call | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Document pipeline | `MathText.attributedString(from: wholeString)` | Prose with embedded math: markdown, chat, LLM output; all 4 delimiter styles; display math centered; document-scoped macros; unsupported math stays visible as source |
| Drop-in view | `VinculumLabel().latex = "…"` (AppKit/UIKit) | Standalone equations; alignment, insets, intrinsic size, opt-in inline errors |
| SwiftUI | `MathView("…").mathFont(.pagella)` | SwiftUI apps; modifiers for font/theme/size/inline |
| Attachment | `MathImageRenderer.attachmentString(latex:…)` | Rich-text composition; baseline-aligned `NSTextAttachment`; cached |
| Image + metadata | `MathImageRenderer.rendered(latex:…)` | Image, baseline descent, spoken description |
| Scene IR + custom renderer | `MathLayoutEngine.make(font:baseSize:)` → `MathScene` → `MathSceneRenderer.draw` or your own (glyph resolution via public `MathFont.ctFont(size:)`) | PDF pipelines, custom drawing, headless layout |
| SVG (server-side) | `MathSVGRenderer.svg(for: scene, embeddedFont: otfBytes)` | Linux/Vapor/static-site rendering; self-contained SVG with embedded font |

Code example (the LLM case):

```swift
textView.textStorage?.setAttributedString(
    MathText.attributedString(from: modelResponse))
```

### G4 — Fonts

Deep detail: [FONTS.md](https://github.com/clintecker/Vinculum/blob/main/docs/FONTS.md).

| Feature | Specific |
| --- | --- |
| Bundled fonts | Latin Modern Math (default), TeX Gyre Termes Math, TeX Gyre Pagella Math, STIX Two Math, Fira Math (sans-serif) |
| Bring-your-own | `MathFont(url:)` for any OTF with a MATH table; refuses fonts without one |
| Per-font truth | Constants/typography/variants/assemblies parsed per font at load; per-font render caching |
| Measured differences | Axis heights 0.250 (LM) / 0.258 (STIX) / 0.280 (Fira); `DisplayOperatorMinHeight` 1.3–1.8 em across faces; STIX ships cut-in kern data for 233 glyphs |

- Glyph-by-glyph comparison grid (fonts as columns): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clintecker/Vinculum/gallery/08-font-glyphs.png
- Alphabet/script letterform sub-specimen per font: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clintecker/Vinculum/gallery/09-font-alphabets.png

### G5 — Accessibility

| Feature | Specific |
| --- | --- |
| Spoken math | ClearSpeak-style utterances generated from the same tree that was typeset ("x equals the fraction negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4 a c, over 2 a") |
| Coverage | Fractions (incl. "1 half" simple forms), roots, scripts (squared/cubed/power), fences, matrices row-by-row, cases, binomials, accents, operators, ~80 symbol names |
| Where it applies | `VinculumLabel`, `MathView`, and every attachment image (math inside text views reads aloud) |
| API | `MathSpeech.describe(node)`; `RenderedMath.spokenDescription` |

### G6 — Reliability, safety, performance

| Feature | Specific |
| --- | --- |
| The fallback contract | Unsupported input degrades to named, visible source — never a broken half-render; `nil`/`isRendered` lets hosts keep their own fallback |
| Bounded parsing | Linear pre-scan + runtime depth counter; adversarial input (50 KB of `\sqrt\sqrt…`, 5,000 open braces) degrades instead of crashing |
| Fuzz-proven | Deterministic grammar/mutation/depth-attack corpora (4,000+ inputs): zero crashes, zero non-finite geometry |
| Adversarial font bytes | MATH-table parser is fully bounds-checked; crafted tables can't OOB or force multi-GB allocations |
| Caching | Content+theme+size+font keyed `NSCache`, count- and byte-bounded; negative caching for known-unsupported input |
| Measured performance | Cold parse→layout→raster ~0.3 ms; warm cache hit ~0.7 µs; headless layout ~40 µs (Apple silicon medians, enforced as test ceilings) |
| Concurrency | Swift 6 strict concurrency; immutable `Sendable` fonts/engines; audited lock discipline |

### G7 — Developer tooling

| Feature | Specific |
| --- | --- |
| Parse diagnostics with source ranges | `MathParser.diagnostics(for:)` → snippet + message + `Range<String.Index>` per issue (editor squiggles) |
| LaTeX round-trip | `MathNode.toLaTeX()`, render-equivalent and idempotent (copy-as-LaTeX, editing) |
| Hit-testing substrate | Opt-in `collectHitRegions` → `MathScene.hitTest(point)` → deepest subtree + rect + LaTeX (tap-to-inspect, selection) |
| Node model | Public `MathNode` tree with `children` traversal; `isFullySupported`, `unsupportedCommands` |
| DocC | Curated catalog (landing, Getting Started, Rendering Documents) |
| Demo app | `swift run VinculumDemo` — paste-and-render with font picker and dark toggle |

### G8 — Engineering & verification (trust signals)

| Feature | Specific |
| --- | --- |
| Test suite | 235 tests: headless geometry (Linux), golden-image regression with coverage ratchet, per-font canaries, fuzz, performance ceilings, the p. 170 spacing chart pinned cell-by-cell |
| CI matrix | Linux (headless layout), macOS (full suite), iOS simulator (runtime tests), gallery auto-publish |
| Golden discipline | 93 pixel-pinned fixtures; a fixture that *starts* rendering fails CI until promoted (coverage can't silently change) |
| Ground truth | MATH-table parsing pinned against committed raw font bytes and fontTools; inter-atom spacing pinned against the TeXbook p. 170 chart |
| Docs as verification | ~38 gallery images regenerate from the live engine on every push to `main`; a wrong-looking figure means a wrong engine (this pipeline caught a mis-seated `\vec` arrow and a chart-coverage regression) |
| Docs | Rule-by-rule TeX Appendix G audit ([ALGORITHM.md](https://github.com/clintecker/Vinculum/blob/main/docs/ALGORITHM.md)) stating Implemented/Partial/ABSENT honestly, with a rendered figure per rule cluster |

## Approach matrix (generic, no named competitors)

| Concern | WebView JS renderer | Server-side image | Vinculum |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime footprint | JS engine + web process per view | Network dependency | In-process, zero dependencies |
| Text integration (baseline, selection, line-breaking) | Snapshot only | Snapshot only | Native `NSTextAttachment` in the text system |
| Offline / privacy | Varies | No | Yes, fully on-device |
| Typography source | Web fonts + CSS | Varies | The font's own MATH table, per glyph |
| Macro-package breadth (mhchem, siunitx…) | Widest | Widest | Everyday-math subset by design |
| Deterministic/testable output | Engine-version dependent | Service dependent | Golden-pinned, headless-testable |
| Accessibility of math content | Varies | None (image) | Generated spoken math everywhere |

## Note on documentation modularization

Current modules are already single-topic. If further splitting is wanted
for a site, the natural seams are: FONTS.md → per-font pages;
COVERAGE.md → per-category pages (structures/environments/symbols);
ALGORITHM.md → per-rule anchors already exist (deep-linkable as-is).
Cross-linking is in place between README ↔ docs/* ↔ gallery.

# ``VinculumRender``

Native LaTeX math typesetting: real glyph shapes and TeX metrics from the
font's OpenType MATH table — no WebView, zero dependencies.

## Overview

Vinculum parses LaTeX math into a TeX-style node tree and typesets it with
an OpenType MATH font, following Knuth's algorithm (Appendix G of *The
TeXbook*) with everything read from the font at runtime: all 56 layout
constants, per-glyph italic corrections and accent attachment points,
cut-in kerning, size-variant ladders, and glyph assemblies for arbitrarily
tall fences and radicals.

Three ways in, from highest-level to lowest:

```swift
// 1. A whole document — prose with embedded math (chat/LLM output, notes):
textView.textStorage?.setAttributedString(
    MathText.attributedString(from: modelResponse))

// 2. A drop-in view:
let label = VinculumLabel()
label.latex = #"x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}"#

// 3. One equation as a baseline-aligned attachment:
let attributed = MathImageRenderer.attachmentString(
    latex: #"e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0"#, display: true,
    mathTheme: .light, baseSize: 15)
```

Every equation carries a spoken-math description, so VoiceOver reads
mathematics aloud. Unsupported input degrades to visible styled source —
never a broken half-render.
